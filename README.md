## Introduction

### Preface

> The right information at the right moment changes lives. The right information at the right moment saves lives. 

This was my mantra, my highest design principle behind the Natural Language Cognitive Architecture (NLCA, or “nalka”). Everything I designed and tested flows from this core purpose. Whether you are a frustrated and tired parent, a busy doctor, or a soldier on the battlefield – correct information is the key to success and survival.

This book is meant for people who want to implement and experiment with NLCA. Secondarily, this book is for anyone who is curious about AGI and cognitive architectures. For those attempting to implement NLCA, you should already possess intermediate programming skills (such as Python) as well as some knowledge of databases and APIs. All other readers should have at least some understanding of AI and machine learning concepts – I will do my best to explain ideas with analogies, metaphors, and diagrams but some background knowledge will always help.
